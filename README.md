<!-- If you have screenshots you'd like to share, include them here. -->

## Setup
To replicate the development environment for this Python project, it is recommended to utilize venv along with requirements.txt. This combination allows for easy isolation and installation of dependencies across different environments. The requirements.txt file contains a concise list of dependencies and their versions, facilitating seamless setup in new environments. Additionally, this project has been modified to adapt to Heroku's deployment method, making it ideal for deployment on the platform. Simply create a virtual environment using venv, activate it, install dependencies from requirements.txt using pip, and follow the documentation for instructions on deploying to Heroku.

## Usage
### Development and Testing

To start a local server for development or testing purposes, you can use `runserver.py`. This script launches a Flask-built-in server. However, please note that this server is intended for development or testing only and may not be secure for production use.

```bash
python runserver.py
```
### Deployment
When deploying the application for production, it's recommended to use WSGI. We've included Waitress in the requirements for this purpose. You can use the following command to start a production-ready server:
```bash
web: waitress-serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=$PORT --call flaskBlackjack:create_app
```
This command starts Waitress and instructs it to serve the Flask application. Ensure to use this method for deployment to ensure security and stability. (!important, if you just want to try it on local, change the host from 0.0.0.0 to something like 127.0.0.1, and $PORT to something like 8000. host=0.0.0.0 will listen for any thing instead of just your local.)


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_. The basic logic is implemented, with more feature can be introduce, we hope we can have do more, but for now, this basic project is done.


## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:
- The animation of the game itself.
- Multiplayer.
	- This can be done with FlasksocketIO, we probably will work on it.
