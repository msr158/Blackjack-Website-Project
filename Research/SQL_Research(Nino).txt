Why am I doing research?:
     The purpose of the SLQ research that I am doing is because it is necessary for the database aspect of the project.


What you expect to learn/do:
        The expectation of what I am supposed to do after researching SLQ would be to implement a way of 
        saving users login information so the user can have all their data saved in the database.
         Additionally, the SLQ research can further help in the project when implementing other features
          such as tracking in game currency, tracking wins etc.


What do you expect to do with it, including any code you expect to write:
        I expect to write code that implements a way to save user login information and also be able to
         register for an account. 


What task(s) in Jira represent the work you will do that was/is dependent on the research/training.:
        The Jira task that represents the work that is dependent is
         "Connect the registration page to database to save user profile".
