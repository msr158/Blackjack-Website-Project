Why you are doing it:
    We are undertaking this project to develop foundational components necessary for later stages of the blackjack game development. 
This groundwork is essential for integrating more complex features in the future.

What you expect to learn/do:
    Through this research, I aim to deepen my understanding of game theory and its application in creating efficient matching algorithms. 
Specifically, I will explore modules such as NumPy for mathematical operations and Pygame for game development. 
This exploration will focus on algorithm optimization techniques and their implementation in Python, directly impacting our approach to the game's logic and player matchmaking systems."
   
What do you expect to do with it, including any code you expect to write.
    The outcome of this research will be directly applied to developing the game's matchmaking algorithm. 
This includes writing a Matchmaking class that incorporates optimized game theory principles to pair players based on skill level or other criteria. 
The code will be structured to ensure scalability and maintainability, allowing for easy adjustments and additions as the game evolves."
    
What task(s) in Jira represent the work you will do that was/is dependent on the research/training.
    This research underpins the Jira task related to 'Develop Matchmaking Games Algorithm.' 
Successful completion of this task is contingent upon the insights and methodologies derived from the research, 
guiding the development of an efficient and fair matchmaking system for our game."
